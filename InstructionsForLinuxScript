Steps to run the Linux Mint 21 hardening script:

1. Open a local terminal session (Ctrl+Alt+T or an on-box console). Avoid remote SSH because the script restarts SSH and changes its port.
2. Change into the folder that contains the script file named `linux scrpt`, for example:
   cd /path/to/RumbleBumble-Scripts
3. (First run only) make the script executable:
   chmod +x "linux scrpt"
4. Execute the script with root privileges so it can apply system changes:
   sudo bash "./linux scrpt"
5. Read the warning banner, then press Enter to continue when you are ready.
6. When prompted, optionally enter a new SSH port number between 1024 and 65535. Leave it blank to keep the current SSH port.
7. Wait for the script to finish. It will install required packages, update configs, and restart services automatically.
8. After completion, follow the manual checklist printed at the end (user accounts, screen lock, hidden files, antivirus scan).
9. Review `/var/log/clamav/manual-scan-*.log` if you kicked off the optional antivirus scan to confirm results or investigate detections.
10. If you changed the SSH port, reconnect using:
   ssh your-user@your-host -p <new-port>

Important:
- The script disables IPv6 and can affect remote connectivity; ensure you have console access before running it.
- Supported platform: Linux Mint 21.x (and point releases) only.
